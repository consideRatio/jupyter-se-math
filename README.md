## Gradient descent (Swedish only currently)
Let your high school students studying derivatives learn a practical application related to machine learning or in other words the creation of artificial intelligences.

### Usage advice
* MyBinder.org can let students run code on their servers in the cloud for free, but their work will not be saved. They can download the notebook file (.ipynb) and upload it later though. And if they are done and want to show you their work, they can download the file as an HTML webpage and submit it to you.
* The laboration will probably take 1-3 hours for the students depending on experience and effort towards quality.
